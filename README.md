## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is Emilio's Github page.

I work on making interactive theorem provers easier to use, with a particular interest in using state-of-the-art programming language techniques to facilitate HCI and ML research! See my [personal page](https://www.irif.fr/~gallego/) for more information about me and my projects.

Don't hesitate to get in touch with me via [Coq's Zulip](https://coq.zulipchat.com/)! Have fun hacking!

My usual pronoums are `he/him/Ã©l` tho I'm very happy to be addressed by other pronoums too.
