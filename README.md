## Hi there 👋, this is Emilio's Github page.

I work on making interactive theorem provers easier to use, with a particular interest in using state-of-the-art programming language techniques to facilitate HCI and ML research! See my [personal page](https://x80.org/emilio/) for more information about me and my projects.

Don't hesitate to get in touch with me via [Rocq's Zulip](https://rocq-prover.zulipchat.com/)! Have fun hacking!

My pronoums are `he/him/él`.
